The bakery project cosists of three  modules: Clients, Bakery and Warehouse.
In the client module, the clients can order products. Authentication and authorisation are done using an IAM platform.
Bakery is a MVC module with which the baker can regiser new ingredients and create products.
Warehouse keeps track of the amounts of ingredients available.
The three modules communicate with each other using Rabbit MQ.
